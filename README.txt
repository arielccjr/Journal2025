    ~FALLACY: A linguistic error 
        : Fallacies in language, clarifying ambiguous terms, sentence structure, or assumptions usually suffices. 
            : Equivocation: Using a word with multiple meanings ambiguously in an argument. “The law should be followed because it is the ‘law of nature,’” 
            : Amphiboly: Ambiguity arising from poor sentence structure or unclear phrasing. “Flying planes can be dangerous,” 
            : Accent: Changing the meaning of a statement by emphasizing different words. “I didn’t say she stole the money,” 
            : Composition: Assuming what is true of parts is true for the whole. “All parts of the car are lightweight, so the whole car must be lightweight,” 
            : Division: Assuming what is true of the whole is true for each part. “The team is successful, so every team member is successful,” 
        : Fallacies Outside Language: focusing on the logical structure, causation, or evidentiary support is essential. 
            : Begging the Question (Petitio Principii): Assuming the truth of what the argument is supposed to prove. “Reading is beneficial because it’s good for you,” 
            : False Cause (Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc): Assuming that because one event follows another, the first caused the second. “I wear my lucky charm, and my grades improved,” 
            : Accident: Misapplying a general rule to an exception or specific case. “Cutting people is wrong, so surgeons are immoral,” 
            : Converse Accident (Hasty Generalization): Drawing a broad conclusion from a limited sample. “One politician lied, so all politicians are liars,” 
            : False Analogy: Comparing two things that aren’t sufficiently similar in relevant aspects. “Employees are like nails; you have to hit them on the head to make them work,” 
            : Slippery Slope: Assuming a small first step will lead to a chain of extreme events. “If we let students redo assignments, they’ll expect to retake exams,” 
            : Ad Hominem: Attacking the person instead of the argument itself. “You shouldn’t listen to her because she’s not a scientist,” 
            : Appeal to Authority (Ad Verecundiam): Relying on an authority figure outside their area of expertise. ei. a celebrity endorses a health product, 
    ~SYLLOGISM: A logical argument where a conclusion follows necessarily from two premises. 
        : It has three parts:
            : Major term: Found in the major premise and conclusion. "All mammals (Middle Term) are warm-blooded. (Major Premise)" All humans are mortal. (Universal and necessary premise)
            : Minor term: Found in the minor premise and conclusion. "Whales are mammals. (Minor Premise)". Socrates is a human. (Particular known fact)
            : Middle term: Links the two premises but does not appear in the conclusion. "Therefore, whales are warm-blooded. (Conclusion)". (Demonstrated conclusion)
        : Identifying Syllogistic Figures & Moods: based on how terms are positioned.
            : Figure 1: Middle term is subject in one premise, predicate in another.
            : Figure 2: Middle term is predicate in both premises.
            : Figure 3: Middle term is subject in both premises.
            : Figure 4: Middle term switches placement.
        : Each figure contains valid or invalid moods, which define how premises are arranged using:
            : A (Universal Affirmative: "All A are B"). 
            : E (Universal Negative: "No A are B")
            : I (Particular Affirmative: "Some A are B"). 
            : O (Particular Negative: "Some A are not B")
    ~STATEMENT: are combinations of words that express truth or falsity.
        : Contradictory statements: One must be true, the other false.
            : Affirmation: “Socrates is wise.”
            : Negation: “Socrates is not wise.”
        : Contrary statements: Both cannot be true, but both can be false. 
            : “All men are wise.” 
            : “No man is wise.”
        : Modal Logic/Implication: Helps in predicting future truths without contradiction.
            : Necessity: Something must be true. “The sun must rise.”
            : Possibility: Something may or may not be true. “It may rain tomorrow.”

                    ~2: Self-Attention Mechanism
                        Instead of using RNNs, the Transformer calculates attention scores for all words in a sentence simultaneously.
                        Multi-Head Attention enables different aspects of word relationships to be captured.
                    ~3: Positional Encoding: Since Transformers do not process sequences sequentially, positional encoding is added to retain information about word order.
                    ~4: Feed-Forward Layers: Each word's representation is passed through fully connected layers to extract deeper features.
                    ~5: Masked Self-Attention in the Decoder: Prevents words from attending to future words (maintains causality).
                    ~6: Output Prediction: The decoder predicts the next word using a softmax function, generating the final output.
                    ~7: Optimization and Training
                        Uses the Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling.
                        Dropout and Label Smoothing are applied for regularization.
                        Beam Search is used for better sentence generation. 
                ~SEARCH/Queries: Retrieves specific data from the database. To access and analyze stored information.
                    ~1: Define Initial State: Start with a known state.

                    ~4: Store in Frontier: Maintain a list of unexplored nodes.
                    ~5: Use Search Strategy: Choose the next state based on the algorithm.
                    ~6: Avoid Infinite Loops: Track visited states to prevent redundant exploration.

        ~4: REFUTATION (Refutatio): Anticipates counterarguments and disproves them. Primarily focusing on eristic (contentious) arguments used in debate 
            : For fallacies in language, clarifying ambiguous terms, sentence structure, or assumptions usually suffices. 
                : For Equivocation: clarify that legal law and natural law are distinct concepts, thus invalidating the argument’s logic.
                : For Amphiboly: clarify whether they mean that piloting planes is dangerous or that planes in flight are hazardous.
                : For Accent: show how different emphases change the implied meaning and that no conclusion can be reliably drawn.
                : For Composition: show that a car’s total weight differs from its individual parts.
                : For Division: point out that team success doesn’t imply each member’s personal success.
            : Fallacies Outside Language: focusing on the logical structure, causation, or evidentiary support is essential. 
                : For Begging the Question (Petitio Principii): query if “good for you” is simply restating “beneficial” without further evidence.
                : For False Cause (Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc): query if improved grades may be due to other factors, like studying harder.
                : For Accident: query if surgery is a controlled, beneficial exception to the general rule against cutting.
                : For Converse Accident (Hasty Generalization): query if one instance doesn’t justify generalizing about all politicians.
                : For False Analogy: query if employees and nails are different and shouldn’t be treated the same way.
                : For Slippery Slope: query if that allowing assignment revisions doesn’t logically lead to redoing all assessments.
                : For Ad Hominem: query if the person’s background doesn’t inherently disprove their argument’s validity.
                : For Appeal to Authority (Ad Verecundiam): query if fame does not qualify them as a medical expert, and scientific evidence is required for credibility.
            : TRANSITION:
        ~1: INTRODUCTION (Exordium) & CONCLUSION (Peroratio): Establishes credibility (ethos) and leaves a lasting first impression with pathos.
            : Ethos (Character & Credibility): Achieved through expertise, moral character, and goodwill toward the audience.
            : Pathos (Emotional Appeal): Uses vivid storytelling, analogies, and emotional triggers to influence perception.

            : MEANING:          Let me ask a bigger question: Are we bound by our habits or do we act out of our free will?
            : THESIS:           We are capable of both, but empowered to rise above them.
                                The Three Kinds of Rhetoric (Based on Purpose)
                                    : Deliberative (Political) Rhetoric – Concerned with future actions (e.g., laws, policies).
                                    : Forensic (Judicial) Rhetoric – Concerned with past actions (e.g., guilt or innocence in legal cases).
                                    : Epideictic (Ceremonial) Rhetoric – Concerned with praise or blame (e.g., speeches at events, eulogies).  
            : Re-Point 1:       Habits and instincts strongly influence our behavior.
            : Re-Point 2:       Self-awareness, delayed gratification, and cultural evolution prove our capacity for free will.
            : Re-Point 3:       Addressing counterarguments reveals the balance between instinct and choice.
            : CLOSING:          Ultimately, the power to choose defines what it means to be human.

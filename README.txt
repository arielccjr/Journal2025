    ~SYNTAX-KEY-CODES: OF THE NATURAL-LANGUAGE/FALLACIES.
    ~REFUTATION (Refutatio): Anticipates counterarguments and disproves them. clarify ambiguous terms, sentence structure, or assumptions usually suffices & focus on the logical structure, causation, or evidentiary support is essential. 
    ~SYLLOGISM: A logical argument where a conclusion follows necessarily from two premises. 
        : It has three parts:
            : Major term: Found in the major premise and conclusion. "All mammals (Middle Term) are warm-blooded. (Major Premise)" All humans are mortal. (Universal and necessary premise)
            : Minor term: Found in the minor premise and conclusion. "Whales are mammals. (Minor Premise)". Socrates is a human. (Particular known fact)
            : Middle term: Links the two premises but does not appear in the conclusion. "Therefore, whales are warm-blooded. (Conclusion)". (Demonstrated conclusion)
        : Identifying Syllogistic Figures & Moods: based on how terms are positioned.
        : Each figure contains valid or invalid moods, which define how premises are arranged using:
            : A (Universal Affirmative: "All A are B"). “All men are wise.” 
            : E (Universal Negative: "No A are B"). “No man is wise.”
            : I (Particular Affirmative: "Some A are B"). 
            : O (Particular Negative: "Some A are not B")
    ~STATEMENT: are combinations of words that express truth or falsity.
        : Contradictory statements: One must be true, the other false.
            : Affirmation: “Socrates is wise.”
            : Negation: “Socrates is not wise.”
        : Contrary statements: Both cannot be true, but both can be false. 
        : Modal Logic/Implication: Helps in predicting future truths without contradiction.
            : Necessity: Something must be true. “The sun must rise.”
